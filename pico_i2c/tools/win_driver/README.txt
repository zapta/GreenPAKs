This windows driver was downloaded from https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed/tree/2.0.0/drivers
and it solved the automatic upload issue with the Arduino framework.

To install, 
1. Connect the RPI Pico with the button pressed to enter the upload mode.

2. In the window device manager update the RPI Boot device, which most likely
   Will have a broken warning and install the driver you find in this directory.
